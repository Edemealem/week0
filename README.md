# Week0 - Project Overview

This project consists of Jupyter Notebooks and scripts designed to perform various data analysis tasks related to the weekly challenges.

## Completed Steps

1. **Data Analysis Notebooks**: 
   - Each analysis task is documented in separate Jupyter Notebook files, created using Google Colab due to computer performance limitations:
     - `eda_correlation_analysis.ipynb`
     - `eda_bubble_charts.ipynb`
     - `eda_data_quality_check.ipynb`
     - `eda_histograms.ipynb`
     - `eda_summary_statistics.ipynb`
     - `eda_temperature_analysis.ipynb`
     - `eda_time_series_analysis.ipynb`
     - `eda_wind_analysis.ipynb`
     - `eda_z_score_analysis.ipynb`

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The `clean_data.py` script, located in the `scripts` folder, handles data cleaning by addressing anomalies and missing values.

## File Locations
- **Notebooks**: Located in the root directory.
- **Scripts**: `clean_data.py` located in the `scripts` folder.

This structure ensures a clear organization of analysis and cleaning tasks for effective review and execution.
